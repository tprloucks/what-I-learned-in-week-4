# What I Learned In Week Four!

* It has been a stressful week but am glad to have been able to learn new and great things at Code Immersives! *

### A few things that I took away from this week are:

1. Booleans
2. If Statements
3. Better understanding of function syntax

=	equal to	A1=D1
>	greater than	A1>D1
>=	greater than or equal to	A1>=D1
<	less than	A1
<=	less than or equal to	A1<=D1
<>	not equal to	A1<>D1

`function testNum(a) {
  let result;
  if (a > 0) {
    result = 'positive';
  } else {
    result = 'NOT positive';
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(testNum(-5));`
// expected output: "NOT positive"
